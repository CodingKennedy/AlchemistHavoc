<h1>Kennedy's Favorite Books</h1>
<div class="first">
  <p>The Alchemist <br />
  <small>This is one of my favorite stories. For me it revolves around magic and spirituality of the self. To listen to ones own heart is what it means to be an Alchemist.</small></p>
</div>

<div class="second">
  <p>The Night Circus<br />
  <small>An amazing tale of two rivals of magic. They work in a circus that appears out of thin air and vanishes with the same speed and mystery. Their goal is to defeat the other, but they don't know who it is, or how to fight them.</small></p>
</div>

<div class="third">
  <p>I Am Number 4 <br />
  <small>The tale of the Lorien Legacies. The last 9 of their kind sent to earth to protect it and find each other. They each have different abilities, but so does the other race of alien hunting them down. This one is an amazing adventure with many twists and turns.</small></p>
