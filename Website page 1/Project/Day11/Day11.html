    <p><a class="more-bio">Union Square</a><span class ="more-bio-text"> is one of my favorite places in the city! If you are looking for me, I am either at home or Union Square. One day I hope to live here. My friends and I  hangout a lot when we were in high school and college. It is a perfect placed with everything you could possible need! There are a bunch of electronic stores nearby. I love electronics and games, a lot! Across the park is a Barnes & Nobles that has 4 floors!!! I love books just as much as I love games and gadgets. I could wander through the store for hours just skimming through all of the books! The park in the center is a ton of fun to relax in. I normally go with friends there and we catch up on what adventures we have all been going through. Every Saturday and Wednesday a farmers market appears in the park. All of the fresh fruits, vegetables and plants are amazing! Union Square is filled with a bunch of restaurants that I love. Panera is one of them! </span></p>

The space gets super packed from all of the tourists, but it is still amazing. So many people from all over the world come to visit. I have never been to Times Square for new years, but that is one of my dreams.Everything about Times Square will amaze you. The lights, the people, the food. There are so many shopping areas near by. This part of the city is literally alive because of the energy that people bring with them. Everything that you would would want to entertain you lives right in Times Square.</span></p>

    <p><a class="Williams">Williamsburg.</a><span class ="Williamsburg-summary"> I am a native New Yorker. I was born in Bushwick, but I grew up in Williamsburg. The Williamsburg I grew up in was a different place from what it is now. It was a lot more industrial. The people were different. I loved it. This place is my home. Recent years has made it stranger, in a good way. The population has changed and a lot of different people have brought a new life to the area. Hipster have taken over most of Williamsburg. With them came an influx of new stores, restaurants. It is a place for new businesses to thrive. Walking through my old neighborhood, it feels like a whole new world. I love wandering through the new Williamsburg. You are bound to find something odd and different that will catch your fancy. </span></p>

    <p><a class="Circle">Columbus Circle </a><span class ="Columbus-Circle-summary">I went to school near columbus circle for about seven years. My high school and my first college were both in the same area. Columbus circle was a great get away for me, and it still is. There is a shopping center that is just amazing to be in, with a Whole Foods in the basement! There used to be a book store on the second floor. I used to spend most of my afternoon looking through books and comic books.
To this day I still meet my best friends at columbus circle. There is a status of Columbus in the center staring out to the old world. water fountains surround his statue. Just across the street is the 59th street entrance to central park. This whole area feels like magic for me. It is very different from anything I had seen before. I still go here on days I need to find some adventure.</span></p>

    <p><a class="Park">Central Park </a><span class ="Central-Park-summary">is an amazing place to hang out in. The park is literally endless. All of the paths twirl throughout the area, they take you on random adventures. You have no choice but to get lost to go where you want to go. The area is beautiful in all seasons. The summers are packed with people playing games, concerts, tourists, the zoo! The winters are colder, open to solitude and quiet.Central park is an adventure just waiting to happen. I normally go by myself or with friends with the sole purpose of getting lost. Every turn you make, you will find something new and exciting to explore. There are statues scattered across the park of Alice from wonderland, Balto, and a whole bunch of historical figures. There is an Obelisk from Egypt hidden in the park. This is one of my favorite places to visit any time of the year.   </span></p>
