    <p>Think of three things that made you happy this week. Go back and recall something that made you laugh, or smile. Think of a scenario that made you feel happy. This could be anything simple. Your favorite meal, good weather, an adventure, being with friends, reading a good book, or even something that you remembered from a while ago that made you happy. Write these three things down and why they made you happy!</p>
