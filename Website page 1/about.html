  <p>I have always been an artist of sorts. When I was younger I loved to draw and color.  I think it was in middle school when we learned different painting styles. That year I won a state competition with a watercolor painting. Even I didn’t know what to think at that! My focus shifted to fiction writing in high school.  I do national novel writing month every November. I currently have 3 unedited novels.
  I know that I am now on the path of my newest creative endeavor. Last January I made the decision to learn how to code. I am extremely happy with that decision. I can use my designer and developer skills, and help you create a place on the Internet for you to express yourself.

  <p>I am a psychology major. Understanding other people is something that I enjoy.  I see people and try to figure them out. Some are extroverted and out going, with lives filled with color in many different shades. Then there are the introverts, the ones who seem quiet, but their minds are dynamic and filled with deep thought.
  The websites I build are based on the same themes. Your online presence needs both of those abilities. They need to stand out as if they are a living and breathing person. It needs to represent you or your business in a way that appeals to others. Good business is transparent and shows everyone exactly what they are about.

  <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
